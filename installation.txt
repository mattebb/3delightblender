PRMan for Blender Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------

First, get and install the Non-Commercial Version of RenderMan from Pixar.  You MUST install
RenderMan before loading the addon.  Package and 
installation instructions at: http://rendermansite.pixar.com/view/get-renderman 
You need to install at a minimum RenderMan Pro Server 20.0

Unpack and move the PRMan folder into your blender addons folder. 
You can then enable the addon in the Addons tab of blender user preferences. 
The addon will by default use the Documents (or My Documents on windows)
in your home directory to render to and create textures.  


ADVANCED:
RenderMan normally bases everything off a variable RMANTREE which is set to your installation
folder, eg /Applications/Pixar/RenderManProServer-20.0 on OSX and C:\Program Files\Pixar\RenderManProServer-20.0 on Windows.

PRMan for Blender will try and guess the appropriate RenderMan version to use and the location of
the RMANTREE folder.  If you are installing PRMan to the standard location you shouldn't have to do anything!

However, if you installed in a non-standard location, set the RMANTREE 
environment variable before starting blender.

This step should not be nessacery in newer versions of the plugin but if you have trouble with the plugin than 
you should set your pythonpath variable to $RMANTREE/bin
